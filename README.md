Spotify Tracks is a single page React application that allows users to search for tracks from Spotify 

The purpose of this project is to understand the fundamentals of React.js by as creating and rendering components, using Props to display data and State to update the data.

# How The Application Works

Once the user successfully launches the application in a browser. The user can search for songs by typing the name of the track. The search queries an external Spotiy API that returns the tracks name, the artis, the album name and the album artwork. The user is also able to listen to a 30 second sample of the song by clicking the play button on the album face.
